## :book: About The Project

### Description

An App to get articles of a specific account from blogging platforms

- Reasons that I built this app
  - Many users may use multiple blogging services such as Medium and dev.to.
  - It's hard to have to open multiple services when we want to view a specific user's posts all at once.
  - That's why I build this app to get articles of a specific account from blogging platforms if a user has the same account name.

### Functionalities

- Browse articles of a specific account
- Register articles to my favorites
